# Romantic Coding Girl

## Overview
A cute animated Valentine's website featuring a pink love truck that drives across the screen and a trembling envelope with a love letter that reveals on click. The site includes multiple interactive sections: an envelope with a love letter, romantic quotes, gift boxes with GIF collections, music player, and a heartfelt personal note.

## Project Architecture
- Pure static HTML/CSS/JS website (no build step)
- `index.html` — main multi-section page with envelope, quotes, gifts, music, and notes
- `loveTruck.html` — standalone love truck animation page (final surprise)
- `loveTruck.css` — truck animation styles
- `envelope.css` — envelope animation styles
- `assets/` — contains GIFs (p1.gif, abdominal.gif, sleep.gif, music_cat.gif) and audio (perfect.mp3)

## How to Run
